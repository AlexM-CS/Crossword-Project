class Cell:
  self.row - x-coordinate in the grid
  self.col - y-coordinate in the grid
    these two could probably be stored as a tuple?

  self.letter = None - can be overwritten later on to hold a letter

  self.index = None - can be initialized later on to hold an index (where a word will be placed)
  self.direction = None - boolean that stores the direction of the word
    these may want to be stored as a tuple as well?
    potentially even a list of tuples, as a single cell
    can have up to 2 words starting there
